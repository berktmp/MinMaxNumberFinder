# MinMaxNumberFinder
In this program, the user is prompted to enter the value of N, which represents the number of counting numbers they will enter. The program then uses a for loop to iterate N times.

Inside the loop, the program prompts the user to enter a number, which is stored in the number variable. It then compares the number with the current largest and smallest numbers stored in the largest and smallest variables, respectively. If the number is larger than the current largest, it updates the value of largest. Similarly, if the number is smaller than the current smallest, it updates the value of smallest.

After the loop finishes, the program prints the largest and smallest numbers to the console.

Note: In this program, we assume that the user will enter at least one number (N > 0). If you want to handle the case when N is 0 or negative, you can add appropriate input validation code.
